### Ames Iowa Kaggle Competition

#Goal is to create a predictive model of house prices based on various characteristics.

##Planning and Execution:
Starting off I wanted to get a feel for the information. Figure out what was proper and needed cleaning, and went a head and cleaned that data. Put in mode for variables that would be dummied, and put in median for numerical variables. Then I standardized the information and created dummy variables. Then I train test split, and finished up from there and ran a multi-linear regression.

## Next time:
If I had more time I would explore further in the data, and work with different variables. I would concentrate more on maximizing performance in a given dataset.
